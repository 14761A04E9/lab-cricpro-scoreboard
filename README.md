Tests
Ohh yes! We have our beloved tests, and you already know how this works.
Open the SpecRunner.html file on your browser and start coding to pass the test. 
Remember to focus on one test at a time and read carefully the instructions to understand what you have to do.
```
```
Trial 1: !
Every team starts off with a manager. 
We need someone to take care of them when Alex isn't around. 
Create a function createManager() that gets the manager's details managerName, managerAge, currentTeam, trophiesWon in the same order, and return an array with the manager's details.
```

Trial 2: Let's pop it off!
