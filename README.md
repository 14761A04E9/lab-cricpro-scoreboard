LAB | ProGrad Premier League
Alex is a young enterprenuer who is out to assemble his own football team to enter the FPL. Ambitious much? Well, he seems to have to resources to do it though. He has collected data of players across various teams. He now needs to arrange this data so he can make sense of it. He needs an application that will help him compare and contrast abilities of different players.

Alas, for all the money in the world, he can't find a decent programmer to help him with this task. He's designed the front-end of the application and it looks great. He needs YOU to help him code functionalities in the back-end though. Go to the src/app.js file and complete all the unfinished code to propel this young man's football dream.

Tests
Ohh yes! We have our beloved tests, and you already know how this works. Open the SpecRunner.html file on your browser and start coding to pass the test. Remember to focus on one test at a time and read carefully the instructions to understand what you have to do.

Trial 1: Gotta coach em all!
Every team starts off with a manager. We need someone to take care of them when Alex isn't around. Create a function createManager() that gets the manager's details managerName, managerAge, currentTeam, trophiesWon in the same order, and return an array with the manager's details.

Trial 2: Plan of Action!
