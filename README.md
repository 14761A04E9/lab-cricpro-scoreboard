Most of us are madly in love with cricket right! We all love the moment when India lifted the world cup after 28 years. When you close your eyes and when you think of it. You can feel the adrenaline rushing through our veins.Yes think of it....MS Dhoni was on strike. Nuwan Kulasekara was the bowler. It was the second ball of the 49th over. India required four runs from 11. Kulasekara bowls a full ball and Dhoni winds up to deposit the ball into the stands at long on. At that moment, a billion Indian fans cheered and celebrated. History was made. After 28 years, on April 2, 2011, India had finally won the World Cup after beating Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final. Phewww what an exciting final!!! Could never forget those..... Now lets come back to our task. The task is very simple. You need to build a scoreboard of 2011 finals of India.

Trial 1: !
Every team starts off with a manager. 
We need someone to take care of them when Alex isn't around. 
Create a function createManager() that gets the manager's details managerName, managerAge, currentTeam, trophiesWon in the same order, and return an array with the manager's details.
